# Python skills for research in Hydrology/Climate science

This repository contains a series of notebooks used in courses to introduce scientific Python to Hydrology students at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This series includes notebooks on basic Python skills, working with spatial data and time series analysis and has been created by Sem Vijverberg and Timothy Tiggeloven.

# Run

To run the notebooks **locally** you need to have python installed. We strongly recommend to install Python rather sooner then later. To install Python, we advice to use a Minicoda(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution and create a new conda environment using:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`. The environment.yml (likely) contains the packages that you will need for all the tutorials and practicums that you will do during your studies.
